<h2> About LBX </h2>
<p> 
Land Betterment Exchange (LBX) is a token built off the ERC-20 Ethereum framework that provides a direct financial incentive to promote and accelerate environmental cleanup of negatively-impacted lands from the fossil fuel industry while also creating new well-paying environmental jobs in hard hit communities.
 
LBX is the first ever market-based program that truly incentivizes people to fix the environmental impact and restore the land from the fossil fuel industry, while also creating a positive incentive to pull forward and transition the world away from fossil fuels. The LBX market value and LBX Token Issuance Process has been established to reflect the efficient market and demand for restoring the land from impacted properties. On the secondary market, the higher the value of the LBX, the greater the financial incentive for people to clean up the environment.
 
As the value of LBX continues to increase, there will be an inflection point where it becomes more valuable for companies to shut-down the remaining fossil fuel activities and transition their workforce to environmental remediation.

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>ICO stands for a token or cryptocurrency initial offering crowdsale. It is a common method in blockchain space, decentralized applications and in-game tokens for bootstrap funding of your project.</p>
<p>This project aims to provide standard, secure smart contracts and tools to create crowdsales for Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As the writing of this, Ethereum smart contract ICO business has been booming almost a year. The industry and development teams are still figuring out the best practices. A lot of similar smart contracts get written over and over again. This project aims to tackle this problem by providing reusable ICO codebase, so that developers can focus on their own project specific value adding feature instead of rebuilding core crowdfunding logic. Having one well maintained codebase with best practice and security audits benefits the community as a whole.</p>
